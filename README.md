# Fortress

A leaner meaner version of Castle Windsor primarily targetting dotnet core. Not replacing Castle mind you, just giving them
room to breathe while they figure out how to migrate their API's. There is a lot there to deal with and they are lacking 
contributors. That said, let's move on to castle.windsor on dotnet core! :)
