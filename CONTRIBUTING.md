#Fortress:

Conributing to this project does not mean your changes will make it to Castle. Your changes will be happily accepted here. 
We test your PR's using AppVeyor. If the test count does not go down(preferrably up) and all the tests pass, you are good to go! 
Please dont do stupid shit like refomatting code using resharper with your own settings. We dont accept merge conflicts, period.
